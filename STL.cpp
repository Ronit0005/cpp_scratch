/*
STL : container + algorithm + iterators .
container -> Object which stores data 
algorithm -> procedure to process data 
iterators -> object which points to an element of containers .

Types of containers :-
1. Sequence containers : stores data in linear fashion (vector ,list ,dequeue).
2. associative containers : (Like : set and dictionary) they are designed for faster access .direct access  (map , multi-map, set , multi-set)
3. derived containers : They are derived from sequence and associative container . Real world modelling .(stack , queue , priority queue)

Sequence container :Ex: Vector  RA fast ; insertion and deletion slow (compared to array of c++);insertion at the last fast .
Ex: list : RA slow ;insertion in mid fast ;insertion at the end fast ;

Asscociative container : all the operation are fast except RA , which is slow 

Derived container : depends
